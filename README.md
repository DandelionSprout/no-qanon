# QAnon, conspiracy, fake news and nazi blocklist for using in a hosts file, adblock extension, pihole or with dnsmasq


https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rimu/no-qanon/master/etc_hosts.txt is the blocklist to use in a /etc/hosts file, adblocker browser extension or a pihole.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rimu/no-qanon/master/dnsmasq_hosts.txt is for using with the dnsmasq DNS server software.

You will probably want to append the IPv6 version also.



See also https://github.com/jmdugan/blocklists/tree/master/corporations and consider blocking twitter, youtube and facebook also as most people into this stuff get their fix on those platforms.

https://github.com/antifa-n/pihole/blob/master/blocklist.txt is a great blocklist also, focused more on fascist sites.
